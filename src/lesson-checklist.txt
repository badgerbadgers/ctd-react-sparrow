Read documentation: https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start

//Setup Router
[x] Open src/App.js
[x] Import BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom
[x] Wrap existing JSX within new BrowserRouter component
[x] Inside BrowserRouter, wrap existing JSX within new Routes component
[x] Inside Routes, wrap existing JSX within new Route component with prop path equal to the root path ("/") and prop exact
  [x]note: the path prop will match any url that starts with the given string, so "/" will match all other urls ("/one", "/one/two", and so on) unless we specify that it must be an exact match using the exact prop
[x] Run your application and view in browser
  [x] Verify that your Todo List still appears correctly

//Add New Route
[x] Open src/App.js
[x] Below the Route component, create a new Route with path "/new"
[x] Inside the Route component, create a level-one heading with text "New Todo List"
[x] Run your application and view in browser
  [x] Verify that your Todo List still appears correctly
  [x] Navigate to http://localhost:3000/new
  [x] Verify that your New Todo List heading appears

//React Router Dom V6 changes
[x]xreact router dom v6 does not need exact prop anymore
[x]must use element prop now
[] optional in index.js you can wrap BrowserRouter around app and strict code and just
  use routes and route in jsx
